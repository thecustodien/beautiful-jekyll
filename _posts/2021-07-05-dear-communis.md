### Dear Communis...

Let me ask that again. What gives? Here we have an institution that believes that they do good by the students. I respect that. Then, we have parents who believe that their decisions are for the good of their childeren as well. I respect that too. Now, let us assume that students hope to do good by themeselves. If every factor involved in this equation does what is perceived to be the good, why is the group with the largest weightage morally outraged?

To my knowledge, we have had two students take their own lives this past academic year. Though I identify as a narcissistic misanthrope of medium intensity, this strikes me. What pushes my buttons even more is the fact that the institution has taken no steps to let the larger student populace in on the knowledge. Maybe academics and education related factors played less than active roles in the motivations behind these self euthanizations. Maybe they did not. However, is not a genteel approach to remembering the students expected of this awfully "cultured" institution? Write back to me on this. You know where to find me.

The institution we study at is marked by a complete lack of a collective identity. Let's see what we can do about it.

Let us have an open conversation. If you have problems, write to me. If you have answers to somebody else's problems, write to me. Write to me even if you just want to rant. As long as the content is not inappropriate or offensive to my judgement, I will publish it.

They say that the the darkest places in hell are reserved for those who maintain their neutrality in times of moral crisis. Though its existance is but mere fantasy, for the sake of this argument, I say that I shalt not go to hell. I'm The Custodien, and I promise to look out for you all to the best of my abilities.

Good morrow, be it friend or foe.

Regards,  
The Custodien
