Dear Sir,

Hope this missive finds you well. I am the Custodien, a slightly disgruntled student from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham. I would like to request clarification on something the whole student body has been thinking about: how the heck did this university, whose upper echelons seem to be made of closeted celibates, manage to be ranked the best private institution in the country? 

Were there some sort of dealings under the table? Apologies, that was an improper question. Kindly allow me to try again. Were there some sort of dealings under the table? My most *mia culpa*. My keyboard seems to be malfunctioning. It refuses to type anything else. That is most certainly a very unforseen occurence. Kindly glance over that *faux pas* as I try to redirect the proverbial compass of this conversation.


I make amendes honorable if this letter seems too impolite. Forgive me. I'm unable to think straight in my stupified state of befuddlement.

Your most humble and obedient student,
The Custodien
