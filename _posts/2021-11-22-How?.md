Dear Sir,

Hope this missive finds you well. I am the Custodien, a slightly disgruntled student from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham. I would like to request clarification on something the whole student body has been thinking about: how the heck did this university, whose upper echelons seem to be made of closeted celibates, manage to be ranked the best private institution in the country? Were there some sort of dealings under the table? Apologies, that was an improper question. Kindly allow me to try again.
