Dear Sir,

Hope this missive finds you well. I am the Custodien, a slightly disgruntled student from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham. I would like to request clarification on something the whole student body has been thinking about: how the heck did this university, whose upper echelons seem to be made of closeted celibates, manage to be ranked the best private institution in the country? 

Were there some sort of dealings under the table? Apologies, that was an improper question. Kindly allow me to try again. Were there some sort of dealings under the table? My most *mia culpa*. My keyboard seems to be malfunctioning. It refuses to type anything else. That is most certainly a very unforseen occurence. Kindly glance over that *faux pas* as I try to redirect the proverbial compass of this conversation.

How does an institution that is the most liberal minded when it comes to most things have draconian views about the others? I'm yet to see another institution in our country where students have the freedom to create, where students have but to ask to be given resources to work with. For that, in all earnestness, I doff my cap to you. However, only a person devoid of all sentiment and sensory input can fail to have misgivings about the state of the residential system. 

I make amendes honorable if this letter seems too impolite. Forgive me. I'm unable to think straight in my stupified state of befuddlement.

Your most humble and obedient student,
The Custodien
