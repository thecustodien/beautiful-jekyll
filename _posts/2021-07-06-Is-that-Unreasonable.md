### Is that Unreasonable?
To: The Dean, The Management
cc: The Class Advisor, Chair of the Department  

Dear Sir,

I've heard rave reviews of the University, and personally really enjoyed it too. Great campus, helpful teachers, good facilities - it was pretty good. So naturally, when the lockdown extended and classes were resumed online, I expected to have no problems adopting to the new platform, I thought regular University activities would have been remodeled to work remotely. Was that too much to hope for? Was that unreasonable?

I should hope not. What I did not expect was to find a platform already developed and aimed at distance education - what joy! It seemed at par with industry leading online course sites - you name it. Udemy, Coursera, edX - it had most of the features. Yay, we'll have a great semester online, I hoped. Was that too much to ask for?

The platform ended being woefully underused, and eventually killed off. Teething issues, I thought. 50 minute theory classes on a laptop - surely, they'd realise no one had an attention span like that. At least, that's what I hoped. 30 minute theory hours followed by online quizzes and activities or group discussions would be good, I knew. There are so many platforms that'd have helped here. And I hoped that'd be recognised, I hoped that the class schedule would be modified to accommodate the medium. Was that unreasonable?

Quizzes and tests on holidays and non class hours, no celebrations or events of any kind. While shows like CES and E3 have gone online, Anokha and Krishnashtami have gone silent.

Exams that are easy to cheat on, and really tough to score otherwise, on a platform that logs you out the minute you try to login, on a good day, and doesn't work at all at times - teething issues? I hoped. It's been three semesters, and nothing has changed. Schedules are still the same, classes monotonous, exams easily scorable if Googled, questions that enable mass copying. Spike in average scores, dip in student satisfaction, interest and high scores. I hoped that would change. Is that too much to expect?

What are we learning for? Marks and grades, is knowledge and practice, or just for the sake of it? As a well intentioned student that just wants a useful engineering degree, I expect the University to do something about the situation. Find ways to combat the situation, come up with ways to solve student grievances. With the fourth online semester about to start, I hope the management thinks things through and comes up with solutions that will work for all the parties involved. Is that unreasonable? Unfortunately, probably Yes.

Sincerely,
John Doe,
A student looking for some quality education.
